Frying suji or rava

Heat ⅓ cup ghee in a kadai or a thick bottomed pan. Keep the flame to a low or medium-low. Use a heavy pan or else there is a risk of the suji getting burnt. When the ghee is getting heated, at the same time keep sugar and water to boil in a pan on a different burner. Steps are mentioned below under the heading “Making sugar solution for halwa“.

There will also be a fragrant aroma of suji and ghee in your kitchen. Frying suji takes approx 7 to 8 minutes on a low flame. this step is important because if sooji is not roasted well then you will not get perfect texture in the halwa. There will be slight raw taste in the sooji halwa.

Handy tip – note that by the time the cashews get golden, the suji will also be fried well. So keep on stirring and wait for the cashews to get golden.
